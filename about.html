  			<p>
    			As you may have guessed, my name is Sanjeet. I'm currently pursuing my Master of Business Administration from <a href="https://www.bsssias.ac.in/"> BSSS IAS</a> Bhopal. I consider myself a reader, thinker, and most importantly an ardent explorer. Previously I completed my Bachelor of Commerce from <a href="https://bsssbhopal.edu.in/"> The Bhopal School of Social Sciences</a> (BSSS). I have a total of 6 months of internship experience at firms such as Mirchi Bhopal (Marketing Intern) and Asiana Times (Content Writer).
  			</p>

  			<p>
    			I'm an avid reader in the sense that I like to read and consume a lot of written content. I read blogs, news articles, essays, and books all the time. Much of my time is occupied reading something or the other. On the side I sometimes watch videos on the topics of my interest and love to share my opinions about things I read and watch on my socials, majorly Mastodon.
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				It's kind of tough to wrap my mind around what should and shouldn't be under the about page. So I will resort to tell you why I have a passion for reading stuff and writing blogs.
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				One of the most important aspects of reading in my opinion is that I have come to know a great deal about this world we live in. The people, the culture, the politics, and science behind it all. Reading about things even if they have no bearing on what I am pursuing provides me with the knowledge about the real world. Some say modern day news is all garbage and deliberately made to scare people off. And while I agree by that to some extent, news is just not restricted to some specific media.
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				We have so many wonderful journalists doing an excellent job on Substack writing about the stuff that matters. We have Hacker News, an excellent news curation and aggregration media where we can find and read the news that matters and affects people the most. If we want to consume news, we have the platforms that are not always trying to make us believe the world is going to end by midnight.
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				And that brings me to writing. I have had my blog on wordpress for over 5 years now. I have written a great deal on the blog trying to coherently convey what I think about people, things, and events. Writing is a powerful method for me to express myself which has more to do with my own understanding than it is for people to understand. But if my writing leads to it, I more than happy with it. At the end of the day, internet is a social place. It would be a scary thing to be the only guy on the internet.
  			</p>

  			<p>
  				That is basically it. I hope you understand who am I based on the above. Consider checking out my <a href="https://astrosanjeet.wordpress.com/"> blog archive</a> and my <a href="blog/index.html"> blog</a> on the site here. I have a somewhat functional <a href="resume.html"> resume</a> up on the site as well for people to get to know me better academically and professionally.
