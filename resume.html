				<h2>Live Projects</h2>

  				<h3>Gen-Z Viewing Preferences (OTT vs. Traditional Screens)</h3>

  				<p>
    				I worked on this live project along with 5 other peers. We made a study on how Gen-Z priotize their source of video entertainment along with what is the percentage of the audience who prefer OTT (Over-the-top media service) vs. Traditional Screens such as televisions. We segmented the results based on demographic factors (age, gender, and location) and the specific preferences of the audience towards one of the many available platforms. We also studied the factors that play a role in the selection of a media and how the Gen-Z think their viewing habits will evolve in the next decade.

  				<h3>Implementation of Weber's Principles at Manglam Electronics</h3>

  				<p>
    				I worked on this live project along with 3 other peers. We visited the Manglam Electronics store located at M.P Nagar, Bhopal and conducted one-to-one interviews with the store and the appliance manager on how they follow the Principles of Bureaucracy as proposed by German Sociologist Max Weber. We learned that as Manglam Electronics is a leading consumer durable store in the prime locality, it follows some of the Weber's principles but others not so much due to their type of business and the lack of any needs to do so.
