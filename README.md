# Sanjeet-Homepage
<p>
  This repository contains source files for my personal website created from scratch using HTML and simplecss. <br>
  
  It was created following the guide by [Blake Watson](https://github.com/blakewatson) at [HTMLFORPEOPLE](https://htmlforpeople.com).
</p>
<p>
  I followed along the guide and made appropriate changes as I deemed necessary to fit the page for my use case. For example, you will see sections such as <strong>Blog</strong> and <strong>YouTube</strong> on the site. I improvised on many areas along the guide and hence the result is in this repository.
</p>

> The purpose of this site is to host basically everything that has do with me such as all my blogs, recommendations, blogrolls, and updates from my YouTube.

## To-do

- [ ] Blogroll
- [ ] Update and refine the homepage
- [ ] Learn how to hide stuff

<p>
  I don't know if that last to-do has the right wording but basically I do not wan't to create clutter on this repository by adding all my blog content, so I want to hide specific parts of the site from the source code and from broswer inspect if possible.
