This repository contains source files for my personal website built from scratch using HTML and simplecss.

> It was built following the guide by [Blake Watson](https://github.com/blakewatson) at [HTMLFORPEOPLE](https://htmlforpeople.com).

I followed along the guide and made appropriate changes I deemed necessary. For example, you will see sections such as **Blog** and **YouTube** on the site. I improvised on multiple areas along the guide and hence the result is in this repository.

> The purpose of the site is to host my blogs, life updates, and content related to my portfolio.

I thank Github Pages for hosting my personal project.
