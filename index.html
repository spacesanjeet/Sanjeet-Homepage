				üîî Latest blog post: <a href="blog/2024-12-26-tennis-in-2024.html">Tennis in 2024</a><br><br>
				My year-end tennis recap is out on the blog now! I have focused on certain players who have made big leaps in 2024 and have made predictions for the tennis calender 2025. Do read!<br><br>
    			üîî <u>Currently reading</u>: <strong>Black Warrant: Confessions of a Tihar Jailer by Sunetra Choudhury and Sunil Gupta</strong>.<br><br>
    			I have just started to read this book after coming across an Instagram reel about a new web series based on the same book. The book is about the experiences of a jailer of the Tihar jail and how he navigated life and career inside the premises with some of the highest profile criminals/villains of modern India. The book is only 208 pages long and because I was searching for a book to read after finishing The Cuckoo's Egg, I picked this one up. I have joined the goodreads challenge to finish 10 books this year and hope this will be one of them.

				My name is Sanjeet. It was pretty evident the moment you landed here and read that clunky heading. Ha! You can navigate to know more <a href="about.html"> about me</a>, read my <a href="blog/index.html"> blog</a>, check out my <a href="resume.html"> resume</a>, or just simply listen to some <a href="youtube.html"> music</a> I have on YouTube (courtesy my good friend!).

				Check out my blog archive at <a href = "https://astrosanjeet.wordpress.com/">this link</a>. Before I made this site, I solely posted on this blog for more than 5 years. And while I still post there, I call this site my home now. Feels nice!

				The social links above are in the order of my preference. I like fediverse! I read and consume a lot of articles and essays from Hacker News and Substack. Check out some of my <a href="https://spacesanjeet.substack.com">Substack writings</a> if you feel like it! 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have my Github as well. I don't consider myself a coder or a programmer of any sort but boast about knowing HTML and basic Python. All knowledge is valuable. I am scarcely active on X now that I have made the switch to Mastodon but I do check it once in a blue moon. And at the end, we have the famous doom scroll social media.
