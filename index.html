    			üîî Currently reading: <strong>The Kite Runner, by Khaled Hosseini.</strong><br>
    			I have just started digging into this book, and it is already one of the most if not the most devastating books I have ever read. The story is heartbreaking, sad, and cruel. The writing is mature, the characters vivid, and the pace smooth.<br><br>
    			I issued the book from the library, the day before my Diwali vacations began in a bid to continue my reading habit I have developed late this year. I have a goal of finishing 5 books by the end of this year, and to be honest, I don't think I will have to try hard.<br><br>
    			I know this book is going to be emotional and the intensity is only going to go up. I have to brace myself for what's to come. Watch this space for updates!<br><br>
    			üìã Blog: I have just read about something known as "character amnesia" and want to write about it from my personal experience. I wonder how it will turn out but let's see.

				My name is Sanjeet. It was pretty evident the moment you landed here and read that clunky heading. Ha! You can navigate to know more <a href="about.html"> about me</a>, read my <a href="blog/index.html"> blog</a>, check out my <a href="resume.html"> resume</a>, or just simply listen to some <a href="fun.html"> music</a> I have on YouTube (courtesy my good friend!).
			</p>

			<p>
				Check out my blog archive at <a href = "https://astrosanjeet.wordpress.com/">this link</a>. Before I made this site, I solely posted on this blog for more than 5 years. And while I still post there, I call this site my home now. Feels nice!
			</p>

			<h2>My socials</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><a href = "https://mastodon.social/@spacesanjeet" rel="me">Mastodon</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=spacesanjeet">Hacker News</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://substack.com/@spacesanjeet">Substack</a></li>

				<li><a href = "https://instagram.com/spacesanjeet">Instagram</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The social links above are in the order of my preference. I like fediverse! I read and consume a lot of articles and essays from Hacker News and Substack. Check out some of my <a href="https://spacesanjeet.substack.com">Substack writings</a> if you feel like it! 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have my Github as well. I don't consider myself a coder or a programmer of any sort but boast about knowing HTML and basic Python. All knowledge is valuable. I am scarcely active on X now that I have made the switch to Mastodon but I do check it once in a blue moon. And at the end, we have the famous doom scroll social media.
