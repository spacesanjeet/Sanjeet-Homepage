				My name is Sanjeet. It was pretty evident the moment you landed here and read that clunky heading. Ha! You can navigate to know more <a href="about.html"> about me</a>, read my <a href="blog/index.html"> blog</a>, check out my <a href="resume.html"> resume</a>, or just simply listen to some <a href="fun.html"> music</a> I have on YouTube (courtesy my good friend!).
			</p>

			<p>
				Check out my blog at <a href = "https://astrosanjeet.wordpress.com/">this link</a>! Before I made this site, I solely posted on this blog for more than 5 years. I am still there. But now I own this place too! Feels nice!

			<h2>My socials</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><a href = "https://mastodon.social/@spacesanjeet" rel="me">Mastodon</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=spacesanjeet">Hacker News</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://substack.com/@spacesanjeet">Substack</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://github.com/spacesanjeet">Github</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://x.com/SpaceSanjeet">X (Twitter)</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://instagram.com/spacesanjeet">Instagram</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The social links above are in the order of my preference. I like fediverse! I read and consume a lot of articles and essays from Hacker News and Substack. Check out some of my <a href="https://spacesanjeet.substack.com">Substack writings</a> if you feel like it! 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have my Github as well. I don't consider myself a coder or a programmer of any sort but boast about knowing HTML and basic Python. All knowledge is valuable. I am scarcely active on X now that I have made the switch to Mastodon but I do check it once in a blue moon. And at the end, we have the famous doom scroll social media.
