    			🔔 Currently reading: <strong>Why Nations Fail, by Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson</strong>.<br><br>
    			Amazinigly, I picked up this book from the library back when I was in my 2nd semester and dived into it as far as 30 pages deep before returning it due to not having enough time on my table to give the book the respect it deserved. I have picked it again now that I have finished <strong>The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini</strong> and feel confident to start all over from scratch.<br><br>
    			Interestingly, the authors of Why Nations Fail won the 2024 Nobel Prize in Economics along with Simon Johnson. I felt amazing when the prize was announced because even if only 30 pages, I was proud to have read from the winners of such a prestigious prize.

				My name is Sanjeet. It was pretty evident the moment you landed here and read that clunky heading. Ha! You can navigate to know more <a href="about.html"> about me</a>, read my <a href="blog/index.html"> blog</a>, check out my <a href="resume.html"> resume</a>, or just simply listen to some <a href="fun.html"> music</a> I have on YouTube (courtesy my good friend!).
			</p>

			<p>
				Check out my blog archive at <a href = "https://astrosanjeet.wordpress.com/">this link</a>. Before I made this site, I solely posted on this blog for more than 5 years. And while I still post there, I call this site my home now. Feels nice!

				The social links above are in the order of my preference. I like fediverse! I read and consume a lot of articles and essays from Hacker News and Substack. Check out some of my <a href="https://spacesanjeet.substack.com">Substack writings</a> if you feel like it! 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have my Github as well. I don't consider myself a coder or a programmer of any sort but boast about knowing HTML and basic Python. All knowledge is valuable. I am scarcely active on X now that I have made the switch to Mastodon but I do check it once in a blue moon. And at the end, we have the famous doom scroll social media.
