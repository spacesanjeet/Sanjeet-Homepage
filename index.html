    			üîî <u>Currently reading</u>: <strong>The Cuckoo's Egg by Clifford Stoll</strong>.<br><br>
    			I picked up this book by complete chance after reading a random Hacker News thread. I don't remember what it was about and also don't remember the contents of the thread on which the book suggestion was posted.<br><br>
    			I am 180 pages into the book have to admit that it is solid. The author is an astronomer who after his grants run out is sent to the computer center at Berkeley and in a week's time finds a massive hole in the network systems which is being actively exploited by an hacker. Cliff narrates the events as they take place and I have found pleasure in reading how he goes about one step at a time in trying to nail down the hacker.<br><br>
    			In other updates, I am planning to write an year-end-review on my blog where I will share my takeaways and happenings in 2024 including all the major events and other developments in my life. I am also planning to share or recommend media, books, and music for which I have found a liking this year. Let's see how it all shapes up.

				My name is Sanjeet. It was pretty evident the moment you landed here and read that clunky heading. Ha! You can navigate to know more <a href="about.html"> about me</a>, read my <a href="blog/index.html"> blog</a>, check out my <a href="resume.html"> resume</a>, or just simply listen to some <a href="fun.html"> music</a> I have on YouTube (courtesy my good friend!).
			</p>

			<p>
				Check out my blog archive at <a href = "https://astrosanjeet.wordpress.com/">this link</a>. Before I made this site, I solely posted on this blog for more than 5 years. And while I still post there, I call this site my home now. Feels nice!
			</p>

			<h2>My socials</h2>

			<ul>
				<li><a href = "https://mastodon.social/@spacesanjeet" rel="me">Mastodon</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=spacesanjeet">Hacker News</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://substack.com/@spacesanjeet">Substack</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://github.com/spacesanjeet">Github</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://x.com/SpaceSanjeet">X (Twitter)</a></li>
				<li><a href = "https://instagram.com/spacesanjeet">Instagram</a></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				The social links above are in the order of my preference. I like fediverse! I read and consume a lot of articles and essays from Hacker News and Substack. Check out some of my <a href="https://spacesanjeet.substack.com">Substack writings</a> if you feel like it! 
			</p>
			<p>
				I have my Github as well. I don't consider myself a coder or a programmer of any sort but boast about knowing HTML and basic Python. All knowledge is valuable. I am scarcely active on X now that I have made the switch to Mastodon but I do check it once in a blue moon. And at the end, we have the famous doom scroll social media.
