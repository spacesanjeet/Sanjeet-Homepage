				This is the first blog post on this site created by me from scratch. It's a great feeling to be able to design a website from the very first file and then move all the way up as we feel necessary. This site is created following the book tutorial by Blake Watson's <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com">HTML for People</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				The tutorial uses basic text and guide on how to make a website ready for individuals with minimal efforts all while making users understand what is happening on the page and things we can improvise on.
			</p>
			<p>
				I believe tutorials like these are essential in today's day and age where everyone should have a personal website. People can have many different uses for websites but to have a place on the internet where they control what happens with their content is crucial in the digital economy.
			<p>
				That is pretty much it for this blog post. Check out <a href="https://htmlforpeople.com">HTML for People</a> if you want to learn more about creating sites and blogs such as these.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thanks for stopping by and have a great day ahead!
