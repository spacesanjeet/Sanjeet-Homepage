				The two were found together holding hands cuffed with a handkerchief. Down on the lake bed. No family to contact. No children. Just two people who made a decision.</p>
			<p>
				“Hello..um, are you free?”</p>
			<p>
				“Yes. Why are you trembling?,” asked Juno.</p>
			<p>
				“Juno..jun..oo.”</p>
			<p>
				“Are you crying? You idiot.”</p>
			<p>
				“Hold for me a minute,” uttered Simu as he locked tight the washroom door.</p>
			<p>
				“Wait, you found him right??”</p>
			<p>
				“Juno its a little complicated.”</p>
			<p>
				“He’s dead. He’s dead, right?”</p>
			<p>
				Simu cries and tears fizzle down his cheek and disappear into the sink, the voice from the open tap engulfing the entire washroom.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				“How much money did he owe to you, Juno?”</p>
			<p>
				“Why does it matter now, ha.”</p>
			<p>
				“100k? 1m? 10m?”</p>
			<p>
				“Something like that. Gone. Gone with him. I hope he enjoyed spending all of it before ending up down there.”</p>
			<p>
				“We are going to arrange his funeral, right?” asked Simu cautiously.</p>
			<p>
				“How much would all that cost?”</p>
			<p>
				“50k? No idea. I have never done this before.”</p>
			<p>
				“50k? What the heck. Somebody died and it costs 50k to do a funeral? I guess every 2nd person who dies never achieves absolution because nobody has that much money lying around.”</p>
			<p>
				Simu stayed silent as he grasped the gravity of the moment for once. Their childhood friend has died and now there they stand with almost no money to spare.</p>
			<p>
				“Maybe this is what he wanted,” said Juno dejectedly.</p>
			<p>
				“He died doing his job, right?”</p>
			<p>
				“Nobody asked him to fall over for a women he was tasked to trap and kill. This is all his doing.”</p>
			<p>
				“He knew how it was going to end. He took the job to do exactly this,” Simu said.</p>
			<p>
				“So tell me again, how much money does the funeral cost, anyways?”</p>
			<p>
				“Juno, you son of a bit…I love you man.”</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				The mortician asked the friends to say their final goodbyes.</p>
			<p>
				“Hey Woo, thanks for everythi..ng man. Take ca..re and don’t worry abo..ut anything now. Thanks for the memories,” a sobbing Simu said clutching the hands of his now deceased friend.</p>
			<p>
				“You owe me 101k now. Take care buddy,” said Juno as a secretly slipped a folded 1k currency note in the pocket of the funeral dress.</p>
			<p>
				The fire accepted Woo at once. There was no struggle. The two friends watched on as the flames completed the final tale of Woo’s life on Earth.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				“Hey, which way is the room no. 67?” asked Juno to the hostel front desk.</p>
			<p>
				“To your right and in the corner.”</p>
			<p>
				Juno opened the door to a small room. A bed, a table, few bags, and some clothing lying around. He finds a picture of the 3 of them, Woo, his wife, and their son. A letter on the table reads:</p>
			<p>
				“I have no words to express my pain for the loss of your child. No thoughts cross my mind and my breathing is now fast as I write this. He is in a better place now, a place where pain doesn’t exist. Isn’t that beautiful?”</p>
			<p>
				Juno lays down on the bed. In battle with the web of lies, thoughts, and promises that shaped his friend’s life. A life which had so much and yet none to know now.</p>
