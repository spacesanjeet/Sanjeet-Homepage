				They were loners. Loners in a world with one too many people.</p>
			<p>
				“Hello, would you be able to provide a spare tent for the two of us to spend the night? We don’t have anything on us right now, unfortunately,” asked Kim Min Song to a stranger who was also on the hilltop to spend the night with his family.</p>
			<p>
				“Yeah, yeah, sure. My wife and I have been looking at both of you standing over here, looking at the sky, for some time now. We were wondering if you need a tent, just in case. Wait a minute, let me fetch it for you.”</p>
			<p>
				“Thanks a lot.”</p>
			<p>
				“No issues; we all help each other. We are a society,” said the stranger back to Kim Min Song as he went back to his tent at a distance.</p>
			<p>
				“We didn’t time our visit very well, I guess,” said Heong Ji, almost apologetically.</p>
			<p>
				“I haven’t timed anything properly in my life. This is nothing.”</p>
			<p>
				“Here you go. This is a bit old and hasn’t been used in a while. Sorry about that. It’s all we got here right now.” The kind stranger with the tent told the two people he had just met.</p>
			<p>
				“Thank you so much. This is better than nothing,” said Heong Ji.</p>
			<p>
				“Well then, all the best setting this up. I would have loved to help you set this up, but my kids are waiting for a board game. I need to go. Goodnight!!”</p>
			<p>
				“Thanks a lot once again,” said Kim Min Song in a loud voice just as he saw the stranger run away to his tent.</p>
			<p>
				“I wonder if he heard it. Good guy,” said Heong Ji.</p>
			<p>
				The pair set up the tent in place and also lit a small fire to keep themselves warm. It was amazing they dared to leave behind everything so they could come here to the hilltop to gaze at the stars and the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
			<p>
				“I wonder if they will look for you. Nobody knows you are on the hill,” said Kim Min Song expecting a reply.</p>
			<p>
				“You mean my husband? I hope he doesn’t call me. He has struggled so much. On his job, to look after his mother and to take care of me. I hope he stops for a moment. Look after himself. Do things he wants to do.”</p>
			<p>
				“You can do that for him.”</p>
			<p>
				“Our marriage isn’t breaking. It won’t break. I am 44 years old. He supported and took care of me when I had a miscarriage last year. He is heartbroken. He never shows it.”</p>
			<p>
				“The nature is cruel. Strong family with no dents. So it is now throwing a kitchen sink.”</p>
			<p>
				“We all live our lives. We live no second life. And yet, I wonder how many people really live that one life they get to live.”</p>
			<p>
				Kim Min Song did not reply. He thought of the words that beamed out of Heong Ji.</p>
			<p>
				“I am a failure, papa,” he finally said, looking straight up.</p>
			<p>
				Heong Ji did not reply. Neither did she look at him. They kept looking at the sky. Finding solace among the stars, far away from their miserable lives.</p>
			<p>
				“Are you sleepy yet?” asked Kim Min Song as he started his way inside the tent.</p>
			<p>
				Heong Ji joined him a minute later, lying parallel to his side. The warmth inside the tent was comforting. They didn’t say anything. There was nothing to say.</p><hr>
