				Loeb didn't understand the place. It was chilly but he could also feel the full steam of the star that overwhelmed the skies. Far off, he could also hear rain pouring down. Puzzled, he kept walking into the wide open canyon before he faced the wall. Every word he uttered came back to him. But it was not the echoes of his own voice. It was somebody else throwing at him the same he did first.</p>
			<p>
				After a short while, unable to grasp the place nor find his way out, he called out. "Show yourself! Whoever is it playing this game with me, pull me out of this, now. Do it."</p>
			<p>
				"Do not resist, my child. Observe, listen, and soak it in."</p>
			<p>
				Loeb turned around to find an apparition of himself. Naked and floating in midair. Too stunned to say anything, he fell down on his knees and put his hands to the eyes. He wished for the dream to come to a close. But time was not a commodity in this place.</p>
			<p>
				Waking up from his short nap, Loeb opened his eyes to find the apparition still in midair but this time far across watching something as the snow fell down on the other side of the wall. He pulled himself together and rubbed his eyes as he walked ahead. "I see you are still here. Care to explain all this before I wake up for real."</p>
			<p>
				"No questions here, Loeb. Look at those people on the beach. Enjoying themselves." Loeb focused into the distance to find himself at 15 years old playing ball with his father on the beach as his mother clicked the pictures. "Now look at this, and this, and this one too." Portals opened one after another all around the wall as Loeb witnessed pieces of his life unfold in grand detail. One where he bullied juniors in high school, one with blood stained floors as he killed his girlfriend after a brawl, and one with him shooting kids outside the school.</p>
			<p>
				"Do you understand it now, my son. Your final dream. Your own life. To relive everything. I shall be your guide as you witness it all from my vantage point. To understand how painful it is to see my own creations destroy the world, one soul at a time."</p>
			<p>
				Loeb fainted for another nap. The Creator will wait for when he is ready again.</p>
