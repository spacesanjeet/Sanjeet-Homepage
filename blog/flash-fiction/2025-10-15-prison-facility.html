				The seats were comfy and for the first time in two months, I felt like I was being taken care of, rather than being carried away. It was unusual. It has just been a few weeks of my stay at the most secure prison facility available in this shithole of a city. They suddenly woke me up in the morning and told me that I need to go somewhere. They didn’t yell at me. They told me. Strange. Also, why did they allow me to board the van myself rather than shoving me inside?</p>
			<p>
				When the driver suddenly turned left instead of right, I realized that… there were only two men inside the prison van. Two men to guard a criminal who was charged with fatally shooting 7 people in his own village? Why? Why are they so confident I won’t kill these two men and flee? Am I being recorded? Why would you do that even though I am already serving a life sentence?</p>
			<p>
				I haven’t been to this part of this city before. I did not know of the routes and obviously had no access to Google Maps. All I could see from the tiny windows was that it was not sunny anymore. Crazy how the weather changes. It wasn’t even 20 mins since I left the facility. The driver, one of the two men I mentioned, abruptly pulled the vehicle. “Good. Take me out of here. Let me see what you guys are up to”, I thought as they opened the gate to let me out.</p>
			<p>
				A gorgeous woman, 4’2 wearing high heels stood in front of me. Long hairs. Puffy red cheeks. Eyeglasses that were definitely fake. But, dressed in a doctor’s clothing. “I have no business with this woman. But I am glad to be here”, I said to the officer who was guarding me. Or was he guarding her? After weeks of no female interaction, my eyes were finally getting a massage.</p>
			<p>
				“We are glad you are here too, Mr. Dotharty”, said the female doctor in a soft tone.</p>
			<p>
				“Thanks for having me here with you. A prison facility with doctors like you, heck yeah. I am all in for it.”</p>
			<p>
				“Shut the fuck up. You are going to have your hemorrhoids fixed today so that we boys in the facility can have some sleep without you shouting your mum’s name all night,” said the officer.</p>
			<p>
				The female doctor let out a huge grin while looking straight at me. “Follow me, let’s fix you today so that you can focus on other things of importance,” she said.</p>
			<p>
				And with it, all my hopes and self-dignity vanished.</p><hr>
