				“Finally, we can make it out of here,” said Rakesh as he started pumping the last remaining chunk of energy in his veins.</p>
			<p>
				“The hole is big enough for us to get out. Do not waste time,” he shouted after looking at his friends lazily swimming behind at distance. For he was not aware of what they are talking about.</p>
			<p>
				“This son of a bitch brought us all here saying this is gonna be the best night of our lives, and here we are, struggling to save our damn lives,” said one of Rakesh’s friends in a low voice.</p>
			<p>
				“I told you, I fucking told you. Imagine wasting Rs. 50000 to celebrate New Year’s Eve in a cave inside a jungle,” said another one of Rakesh’s friends. But this one was loud enough to be heard by him.</p>
			<p>
				“You do not need to imagine it. The shit has already happened,” said Rakesh calmly, as he saw exactly 5 forest guards behind the hole waiting for them to arrest for illegal trespassing in the jungle.</p>
			<p>
				“The party’s over lads. Now slowly swim out of there so we can play a game. I do not want to waste the day taking care of your mess,” said the chief forest guard.</p>
			<p>
				As all 5 friends slowly lined up outside the cave with hands tied behind their backs, the chief ordered one of his assistants to bring the tool. The assistant, fat and slow, handed the chief exactly the tool he asked for.</p>
			<p>
				With a DSLR Nikon D3500 in hand, he commanded the friends to say cheese. The friends, completely flabbergasted, followed the order. The chief got the perfect picture he wanted, for it was his last day on duty before retirement.</p>
			<p>
				“Shoot them all out and take care of the bodies,” the chief ordered as he walked away with the same fat and slow assistant.</p>
