				The passengers started coming out as the train stopped dead on its track. Some were struggling to make a fire, some were taking a walk, and some just lay asleep on their temporary beds.</p>
			<p>
				“Are you hungry?”</p>
			<p>
				“No, I am not. Thanks.”</p>
			<p>
				The cold winter winds were making things tough. Ju Yeon Su though was determined. One hard scratch on the matchstick and the whole thing came alive. In no time, he was warming himself up with a proud smile on his face. People ran towards the two as they saw the first light in the open ground. And in no time, everybody had a fire. Yeon Su couldn’t have been prouder.</p>
			<p>
				“So, coming back to my question from when we were inside the train.”</p>
			<p>
				“Yeah, go ahead.”</p>
			<p>
				“It is strange, really. People here don’t have phones. And those who have it, don’t know how to use it except to receive calls. The electricity is shut off during the night, so trains stop dead suddenly.”</p>
			<p>
				“That’s definitely not a question.” Yeon Su frowned.</p>
			<p>
				“My question is, are we possible?” said Yu Minna apologetically.</p>
			<p>
				“We are possible. More than possible, actually.”</p>
			<p>
				“How so?”</p>
			<p>
				“There is a very famous Indian proverb that fits our situation,” Yeon Su said with a bright smile on his face.</p>
			<p>
				“I am all ears.”</p>
			<p>
				“Sometimes, the wrong train takes you to the right station.”</p>
			<p>
				“God, you really thought this fits our situation here?” said Yu Minna, barely controlling the flood of blush on her face.</p>
			<p>
				“You see, I am determined to make this work. We will have multiple obstacles on our path. These people don’t have phones. Yet they know the correct time, all the time. Some people you said just know how to dial and receive calls. They actually know a lot more. But they have to use their phones for 30 days on a single charge. So they do what they need to do. You might think we are struggling but after some time it becomes a routine.”</p>
			<p>
				“Thanks.”</p>
			<p>
				“For what?”</p>
			<p>
				“The fire.”</p>
			<p>
				“You didn’t like what I said? It’s true though.”</p>
			<p>
				“I liked it. I like it so much that it’s a futile cause to discuss it now. Let’s just do what we need to do.”</p>
			<p>
				The morning hit and the driver sounded the alarms. It was thus time, to board the train. Everyone wants to go somewhere, and yet none of them know where they have to go. They all know one thing though. They need to go.</p>
