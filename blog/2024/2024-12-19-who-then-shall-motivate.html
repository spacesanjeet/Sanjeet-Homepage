			<p>
				Gentlemen, what is the reason we gather here today? Why am I to stand amongst you all to deliver a meek and futile speech? Haven't we been told enough? Or is it that you wait for one last push, either to break our enemies or break away?</p>
			<p>
				In all of humankind gentlemen, there hasn't been one recorded instance of a speech delivered so powerful and so mighty, that it instilled in its listeners the truth of the vanity to fight one's enemies. Who which motivates you does not guarantee you the success you yourself dream about.</p>
			<p>
				Am I to tell you now to flee? To stop chasing the truth and victory you all have so long desired for? And tell me why I should do it. To convince another human being who already has its sight set on something else is like talking down a lion once it has tasted blood in its mouth.</p>
			<p>
				And so gentlemen, what should be expected from me? You will find so many men, a great number of philosophers, and even a greater number of administrators tell you that its one's duty to fulfill and complete the actions they have set on about to accomplish.</p>
			<p>
				Those who motivate men never mention failure as an option. Those men who encourage, never talk about the hurdles and failures set along the way. Those who motivate, motivate for success alone. BE READY FOR THE VICTORY. CHERISH THE MOMENT ONCE YOU GET HOLD OF THAT VICTORY.</p>
			<p>
				So tell me dear all, of hundreds and thousands of you ready to die chasing victory for the great king and your beloved, are you ready also to taste defeats and failures? Are you ready to break away when you see the failure coming your way? </p>
			<p>
				Those who motivate you, those who encourage you, go to great lengths to describe the victories and how to win. TELL ME. DO THEY EVER READY OTHERS FOR FAILURES AND DEFEATS? NO GENTLEMEN, NO, THERE HASN'T BEEN ONE RECORDED INSTANCE IN ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY WHERE THIS HAS HAPPENED.</p>
			<p>
				You must face failure yourself. For all the motivation and the encouragement you might perceive on your path to glory, they will never once prepare you for the failures. Only you, and you alone gentlemen, ready yourself for failures. Readiness and being able to absorb and render numb the failure and the defeat comes from within oneself. No man, no philosopher, no administrator, not even me my brothers, can ready another for failure. </p>
			<p>
				So now you must make the decision here and now. Who am I to compel you people to break away now this deep in enemy territory? We must strive to accomplish our goals and make our enemies surrender. And unless we achieve that gentlemen, ready yourself for failure. </p>
			<p>
				Because it is not me who can bring you the victory gentlemen, you must earn it through your own actions, and thus still, failure is yours even more.</p>
			<hr>
			<p>
				No specific reason why I am writing this. I just happen to be thinking about motivation and failures today while doing household chores and decided to weave something around those words. I wonder what you guys think about this.
